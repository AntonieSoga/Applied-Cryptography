# Encrypted group message

Alice, Bob, and Casey joined an encrypted private group chat to exchange
messages. To join this group, they used QR codes, which were used to generate a
common shared encryption key. The messages are encrypted using `encrypt.py`.

Meanwhile, Shamir managed to get their QR codes and an encrypted message in
`flag.enc`. Your task is to decrypt the flag.
