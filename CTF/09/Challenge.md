# Dutchman's Patrols
 The Flying Dutchman is doing his regular supply deliveries to the Resistance, behind the Iron Curtain.
He is not afraid of being caught, but that would mean his friends won't get the desperately needed transport.
The Resistance was able to intercept messages describing the border guard patrol movements, but these are encrypted.
Luckily, they have an inside man that was able to create a backdoor into the communication system.
Being given the vulnerable encryption scheme, help the Dutchman obtain the used key, so that he might decrypt the intercepted messages and avoid the patrols.

###### Note: Once you get the key, don't forget to wrap it so: `CRYPTO_CTF{<key>}`
