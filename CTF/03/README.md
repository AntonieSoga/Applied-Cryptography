# Perfect Secrecy

Fred heard that there exists an encryption algorithm that provides perfect secrecy, so he encrypted 9 plaintexts. Somewhere inside these texts lies a fragment of his masterpiece.

They are perfectly secret, so he doesn't mind sharing the ciphertexts with you. There's no way you can steal his work.
You can't even guess the name of the masterpiece!

###### Note: Don't forget to wrap the flag like this: `CRYPTO_CTF{<FLAG>} `
